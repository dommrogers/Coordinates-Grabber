# Coordinates-Grabber


This is a utility mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

It allows you to see / copy the name, position, rotation and scene of interactive items.<br/>
The data will be copied in a format suitable for [gear spawns definitions](https://github.com/ds5678/ModComponent/wiki/Gear-Spawns) for ModComponent.

## Usage

* Press `N` to enter name mode where you can see the name of the item under the crosshair.
* Press `P` to enter position mode where you can see the position of the item under the crosshair.
* Press `R` to enter rotation mode where you can see the rotation of the item under the crosshair.
* Press `K` to enter scene mode where you can see the scene name of the item under the crosshair.
* Press `L` to enter loot table mode where you can see the loot table name of the container under the crosshair (does nothing if the item under the crosshair is not a container).
* The scroll wheel can also be used to toggle through the different modes.

* While in name, position, or rotation mode, press the `Right CTRL` key to copy a complete item spawn definition for the item under the crosshair to your clipboard.
* While in scene mode, press the `Right CTRL` key to copy a complete scene definition to your clipboard.
* While in loot table mode, press the `Right CTRL` key to copy a complete loot table definition to your clipboard.

* Press `Alt` to append the information to the default file instead of copying to the clipboard.
* Clicking the middle mouse button has the same effect as pressing `Alt`.
* Press `Delete` to delete the interactible object under your crosshair. Disabled by default.

* ModSettings can be used to customize various aspects of this mod.
