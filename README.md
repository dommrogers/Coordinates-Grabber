# Coordinates-Grabber


This is a utility mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

It allows you to see / copy the name, position, rotation and scene of interactive items.<br/>
The data will be copied in a format suitable for [gear spawns definitions](https://github.com/ds5678/ModComponent/wiki/Gear-Spawns) for ModComponent (when it's ready).
